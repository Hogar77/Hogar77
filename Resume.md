Focused on clean code, testing and secure production deployments.

## Key Skills

- Languages & Frameworks: TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS, JavaScript, T-SQL
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MS SQL
- DevOps / Infra: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, Certbot (Let's Encrypt), systemd, VPS deployments

## Selected Projects / Experience

Hogar77 / sql-api — https://github.com/Hogar77/sql-api

- REST API built with NestJS + TypeScript for core business entities (auth, users, CRUD).
- PostgreSQL backend, JWT authentication, Swagger docs. Deployed with Docker Compose; Nginx reverse proxy and Certbot for HTTPS. Implemented unit tests and basic CI.

Hogar77 / front-b2b — https://github.com/Hogar77/front-b2b

- B2B frontend (TypeScript) consuming the sql-api endpoints. Demonstrates authentication flows, token refresh and secure API consumption. Configures environment variables and deployment via Nginx.

Hogar77 / erp-api-sync — https://github.com/Hogar77/erp-api-sync

- Service for synchronizing local ERP data with external APIs. Mix of T-SQL stored procedures (change capture, normalization, conflict resolution) and TypeScript sync workers. Supports connectivity patterns for on-premise systems without fixed IP (Cloudflare Tunnel, autossh, WireGuard). Includes runbook and deployment instructions.

## Achievements / Impact

- Built reliable sync pipeline between legacy ERP and cloud services, improving data freshness and reducing manual reconciliation.
- Reduced deployment time and errors by standardizing Docker Compose + Nginx + Certbot patterns.
- Delivered production-ready APIs with tests and documented endpoints used by frontend and third-party integrations.
